**Critical Resources:**

Two sources were particularly valuable for the creation of this app. We used the Cal-Adapt API to obtain down-scaled climate data for our region of interest, while Tebaldi et al's "STITCHES" article provided guidance on the method used to construct our scenarios. These resources are cited below.
