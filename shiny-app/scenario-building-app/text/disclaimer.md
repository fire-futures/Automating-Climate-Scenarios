It's important to note that climate predictions focus on larger trends of how conditions are changing and represent averages of the future. It is highly unlikely that any one scenario will be a true reflection of future day-to-day weather. With this in mind, it's important to create numerous scenarios to gain confidence in the full range of possible climate futures.
