# Automating-Climate-Scenarios
This repository holds three directories: Our climate scenario workflow, our Shiny app, and our educational visualizations
To ensure reproducibility and consistency within the workflow, the renv folder and associated .Rprofile and renv.lock files have the package versions that were installed during the building of the workflow. They will automatically load the corresponding package versions when opening the workflow, but loading each library is still necessary.
